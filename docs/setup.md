We assume that you have a PostgreSQL server running on `localhost` at port `5432`, with the user being `postgres`. We also assume that the database `hangry` has been initialized/created.

The following packages are required (developed on Python 3.6.4):

```
alembic==0.9.8
certifi==2018.1.18
chardet==3.0.4

``` 

1. Run `python db_create.py`. This will create the tables in the database according to the models defined in `models.py`.
2. Run `python populate.py`. This will populate the tables in the database with some data in the json files in the root directory.
3. Run `python manage.py runserver`. This will run the server for the API at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
4. Do stuff.

If you ever need to start again, just run `db_drop.py` and start the steps again
